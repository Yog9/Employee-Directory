# Employee Directory
[Demo Employee Directory Here](https://yog9.github.io/Employee-Directory/)

## Summary
Employee Directory used a random user API to generate random users and generate their details. Clicking a user would pop up a modal for additional information.

### Motivation
The purpose of this project was to understand more about communicating with a third-party API using JQuery.

### Getting Started
 * Click the demo link or clone/download the repository on your local machine and open the index.html file with a browser.
 * Click the employee/employee information in the grid to open a modal window with more detailed information.The modal window can be    closed by clicking outside the modal.
 * Enter the name of employee in the search box to filter the directory by employee name.
 
 ### Thoughts
I am still not sure how can I use javascript to call an event listener on dynamically added elements.
 
### Built With
* HTML5 
* CSS3
* JQUERY
* AJAX
* API

### Features
**1. Responsive Design**

**2. Compatible on Chrome 68.0.3440.106 and Firefox 62.0(64-bit)**

**3. Hover state employee information**

**4. Search functionality to filter the directory by name**

**5. Flexbox layout**

### Coming Soon 
- [ ] Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.
- [ ] Closing the modal by clicking the dynamically added element rather that clicking outside the box.
