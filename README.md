# Employee Directory
[Demo Employee Directory Here](https://yog9.github.io/Employee-Directory/)

## Summary
Employee Directory used a random user API to generate random users and generate their details. Clicking a user would pop up a modal for additional information.

### Motivation
The purpose of this project was to understand more about communicating with a third-party API using JQuery.

### Getting Started
 * Click the demo link or clone/download the repository on your local machine and open the index.html file with a browser.
 * Click the employee information in the grid to open a modal window with more detailed information.The modal window can be        closed by clicking outside the modal.
 * Enter the name of employee in the search box to filter the directory by employee name.
 
 ### Thoughts
 I need find different implementation  because the code is not DRY as it should be. Need to study more to refer the working examples of similar type of projects.I m still not sure how can I call an event listener on dynamically added elements.
 
### Built With
* HTML5 
* CSS3
* JQUERY
* AJAX
* API
